## üß© Introduction

***‚≠ê This project consists of a To-Do List API, which has been given the identifying name LEMBRAR-ME, that allows users to efficiently and organizedly manage their tasks. The API was developed using modern and scalable technologies such as Python, Django and Postgresql, and follows good development practices to ensure code quality and security. With the LEMBRAR-ME API, users will be able to create, update, and delete tasks. Additionally, the API has an excellent search feature so that users can easily find the tasks they want to perform. The objective of this project is to provide an effective solution for task management and can be easily integrated with other applications.***

<h4>Step-1</h4> <code>git clone link https://github.com/GabrielSantos198/LEMBRAR-ME_BACK-END/</code>

<h4>Step-2</h4> Change the values of environment variables in the docker-compose.yml.<br/><br/>

Key | Value
|---|---|
DEBUG | True/False
SECRET_KEY | Application secret key
EMAIL_HOST_USER | Your Gmail
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD | Gmail app password
